Welcome to Coding With Kids's documentation!
============================================

Coding with kids can be a *great*
way to not only teach them some skills
that will help them with their
own lives, but also *create or
strengthen* some lasting
**bonds between you and them.**

Throught your journey you will
both likely learn new ``concepts`` and
``terms`` that will expand your horizons and
provide hours of enjoyment.

.. note:: 
   Some kids have problems with screen time
   and if you leave them unattended with a
   screen and they have access to thigs
   like Youtube or games, they may not stay
   focused on the task and hand.
